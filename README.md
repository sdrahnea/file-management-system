## 1. Getting Started

Clone or download a copy of this project.

### 1.1 Prerequisites

This project requires Java 1.8, Maven and at least one database (PostgreS, H2, MySql).

### 1.2 Database installation

#### 1.2.1 H2
No installation is required.
The `spring.datasource.url` is the one required property which should be set. By default, the 
username is `sa` with empty password. Two modes: in memory and file storage. See the `application.properties`
file for more details related configuration.

#### 1.2.2 MySQL 

```
CREATE DATABSE fms;
```

Note: in case that you run the application starting with MySQL 8.0.4, please execute the following query:
```
ALTER USER '${USER}'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '${PASSWORD}';
-- where ${USER} and ${PASSWORD} should be provided. 
```

#### 1.2.3 Postgres
Install PostgreSQL. it is required to create a database:

Please, run the following commands if it is the case:
```
createuser -U postgres -s Progress
```

Please, run the following command to import a database (if it is the case):
```
pg_restore -d DATABASE_NAME <  PATH/BACKUP_FILE_NAME.sql
```

To create the JAR file please use the following command:
```
mvn clean package
```

## 2. Running the tests

All available unit / integration tests are in package: `src/test/java`.
The main rule is: one unit test class for each java class.

## 3. Deployment

If the build (the jar file) is ready then the application can be run. Please, use the following command to run the application:
```
XXX:file-management-system xxx java -jar target/file-management-system-X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
### Deployment & run on LINUX environment
In case if application is run in a linux based instance, please create the following folders:
1. /app         - folder where the JAR is located;
2. /app/log     - folder which will contains the logs;
3. /app/config  - folder which will contains the application configuration files;
4. /app/file-db - production or working folder where service will save physically the content;
5. /app/test-db - test folder where service will save physically the content;

To run the application we have the following options:
```
nohub java -jar file-management-system-1.0.3.jar --spring.config.location=/app/config/application.properties &
```

To show last NUM_OF_RECORDS from a FILE_NAME linux command:
```
tail -n NUM_OF_RECORDS FILE_NAME
```

### Deployment & run on WINDOWS environment
The application was developed on Windows environment. 
We did not test how the application works on PRODUCTION on WINDOWS environment.

To run application, please run this command:
```
java -jar D:\projects\app\file-management-system-1.0.3.jar --spring.config.location=D:\projects\app\config\application.properties
```

## 4. Swagger usage
You can use swagger for testing proposes:
```
URL: APP_HOST/swagger-ui.html  . For example:  http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html
```
